Hive is a runtime and control layer for running software across machine
fleets in environments with poor connectivity and conditions that degrade
electronics and communication, such as space, remote terrain,
underground sites, or the sea. Hive is built for clusters that segment,
keep operating locally, and meet again later.

Hive is designed for mathematical consistency. Each segment can keep
operating from local knowledge, and when segments meet again their state
is reconciled by explicit rules instead of a hidden central truth.

## What Hive Is For

- Machine fleets that cannot depend on continuous connectivity
- Remote systems where communication degrades or disappears
- Software that must keep running during cluster segmentation
- Operators who need local operation and later reconciliation

## Formal Verification

- The design of important system parts is fully formally verified.

## Kubernetes Compatibility

Hive is not standard Kubernetes. It may support Kubernetes-like
deployment workflows, but it does not promise a coherent cluster
network, a central control plane, or one always-current source of truth.
If your software needs one live global truth, Hive is the wrong place to
run it. Cluster segmentation is expected. Local operation and later
reconciliation are part of the model.
